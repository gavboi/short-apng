# short-apng
Creates a 2-frame APNG file that plays once. For use in embeds like in Discord, where only the first frame is previewed, but upon viewing in browser will show something different.

## Usage
Run `create.py` for command line interaction.

Run `ui.py` for controls on a UI.

#### Notes
Requires [pyAPNG](https://pypi.org/project/apng/), and [pySimpleGUI](https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/) if you are using the UI.
