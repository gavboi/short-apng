# Short APNG: A quick way to make 2-frame APNGs 
Creates a 2-frame APNG file that plays once. For use in embeds like in Discord, where only the first frame is previewed, but upon viewing in browser will show something different (plays "animation" to second frame and stops).

## Usage
Run `create.py` for command line interaction.

Run `ui.py` for controls on a UI.

## Notes
Requires [pyAPNG](https://pypi.org/project/apng/), [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [pySimpleGUI](https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/) if you are using the UI.

Currently only works with `.png` and `.jpg` files.
